This is a simple, classic ToDo App, where you can write down task or create a check list and mark them as you complete them.

This was much more easier than the windbnb challenge. Took just a weekend to complete it.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
